## What is the goal?
To show people positive news happening all around the world in an engaging/creative way. All the events showed in The Newsroom are real and the related articles can be accessed by clicking on the respective links.
### Example:
If you see an article like this, there is always a place where you can click to find the full real article. In this case, you would need to click in "here" to open a new tab with the article related.

## What is this?
This is a project made for the [MongoDB World Hackathon '22](https://www.mongodb.com/world-2022/hackathon).
It is also a place where you can find the most relevant (and positive) global news of last month as recorded by the GDELT database.

## What you can do...
Right now you can:
- **Enter The Newsroom:** Move around and talk to other characters in this visual novel kind of game while completing tasks and trying to make front page.
- **Visit the archives:** Find news to share or just learn more about what was happening around the world this last month.
- **Gallery:** Learn more about the different jobs involved in making a newspaper and find more about this project.

## How it works:
The Newsroom is powered by Nextjs, Google Cloud (BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler), [The GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) and MongoDB.
### More in depth:
- The MongoDB cluster lives on MongoDB Atlas and It's updated by a Cloud Function that queries through BigQuery the GDELT database and that is called when a Pub/Sub message is send by the Cloud Scheduler. Right now it runs once a month.
- The Nextjs web app hosted on vercel queries the MongoDB cluster through aggregation.

### Right now the project is live here: https://mongo-db-hackathon-2022.vercel.app/ . All you need to do is click and enjoy!
